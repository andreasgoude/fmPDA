fmPDA
-----
Version 1

fmPDA provides scripts to use the Data API and Admin API without needing to know the
underlying constructs of how to make each call. The curl module wraps around Insert From URL
to handle all the error checking, automatic retries, etc. You can use this on any host, not just
FileMaker's APIs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS
------------
FileMaker 17 or later


INSTALLATION
------------
1. Import the following custom functions into your solution:
    fmPDA.jsonGet()   - This is a wrapper for the JSONGetElement but returns "" instead
                        of a JSON error string on error. We added the fmPDA. prefix to
                        avoid any namespace collisions with other custom functions.
    #()               - Part of the incredibly useful #Parameters module
    #Assign()         - Part of the incredibly useful #Parameters module
2. Copy/Import the fmPDA.v1 folder to your solution.
3. That's it - no layouts, tables, or TO's to add!


USAGE
-----
Check out the Examples script folder in this file. You'll find examples for all Data API calls
and a good chunk of Admin API calls as well. The simplest example is Data API: Test GetRecord
to retrieve one record by recordID. The accompanying 'demo' database can be used with all examples.
Use the Scripts menu to run any of the examples.
